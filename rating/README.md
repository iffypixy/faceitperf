# HLTV rating, reverse-engineered

> Here, we only reverse engineer Rating 2.0. With the (limited) data I have from FACEIT API, it's not feasible to accurately predict Rating 3.0 and Rating 2.1 since those account for entry duels, clutches, saves, etc. Rating 1.0 is too simple and not relevant anymore, so Rating 2.0 is the sweet spot.

First, I collected enough stats samples to fit my linear regression models. I scraped everything relevant to the calculus: KPR, APR, DPR, ADR, MKPR (Multi-Kill per Round) and target features like Rating, KAST and Firepower. All features except Rating 2.0 were pulled from players’ all-time stats. To include only Rating 2.0 (and not Rating 1.0 or 3.0), I filtered by a start date of June 2017 (release date of Rating 2.0) and skipped "new" players who only have Rating 3.0 as their all-time metric.

Second, I fit linear regression models to derive formulae for each target. Feature selection was guided by common sense and official HLTV insights.

I tested each linear regression on test data, and the predicted values line up closely with HLTV’s official stats. With high R² and low RMSE across all targets, these formulae reliably approximate Rating 2.0, KAST, ADR, 2KPR, and Firepower for most players.

`Rating 2.0 = 0.682 + 0.663⋅kpr + 0.322⋅apr − 0.764⋅dpr + 0.00358⋅adr + 0.770⋅mkpr`<br>
`KAST = 85.776 + 14.597⋅kpr + 39.575⋅apr − 46.211⋅dpr`<br>
`ADR = 17.417 + 18.979⋅kpr + 75.556⋅apr + 196.634⋅mkpr`<br>
`2KPR = −0.054 + 0.279⋅kpr − 0.00787⋅apr + 0.000195⋅adr − 0.618⋅3kpr − 0.947⋅4kpr + 0.42⋅5kpr`<br>
`Firepower = −187.051 + 160.349⋅kpr − 15.182⋅apr + 1.362⋅adr + 228.483⋅mkpr`<br>

Some coefficients might look weird because of multicollinearity… but as long as the formulae work, I don’t care 🙃
